                <p>This project involved writing modules in System Verilog to handle the timing of receiving serial digital data from an ADC and converting it to parallel data, digitally processing the signals with finite-impulse response filters implemented in System Verilog, and then converting the parallel data back to serial data that could be sent back to a DAC to be output. </p>

                <p>As part of the design process, Altium Designer was used to design a PCB that would interface the DAC/ADC with the DESoc MAX 10 FPGA we were using for the digital signal processing, which we eventually submitted to be manufactured, then 
                    soldered our compontents to.</p>

                <p> Matlab was used to determine proper filter coefficients that could be used to achieve our desired results, as well as to predict the magnitude and impulse responses of the filters as a measure of their efficacy.</p>

                <p>We also extended template testbenches that were provided to suit our needs and evaluated the digital design using ModelSim 
                    when we were experiencing inconsistent results. This Waveform of our DSP system, is based on specific inputs forced by a 
                    testbench that we modified for debugging purposes when we encountered a situation where our filters appeared to be 
                    working fine in simulation, but on hardware, failed to sufficiently attenuate the RF signals. We attempted to simulate our 
                    pipeline using ModelSim, then hand-calculated a few outputs of what we believed should have been output by the FIR filter system, 
                    and compared them to the values that the simulation was showing. We eventually realized that our inconsistensies were due to 
                    timing issues that were not reflected in simulation but eventually revealed themselves in our design's failure post-synthesis, 
                    which was a very valuable lesson.</p>

                <p>Frequent manual testing using laboratory instrumentation such as waveform generators, oscilloscopes, and DMMs was used to debug and evaluate our design. 
                    For example. generating a test AM signal, demodulating it with our device, and reading the output on an oscilloscope.</p>

                <p>Eventually, automated testing helped us evaluate our final design, for example, sideband rejection ratio as a measure of success.
                     The PyVISA library was used to connect to measurement instruments. The program then controlled stimuli (eg: generating signals of varying amplitudes and frequencies on the waveform generator), 
                     then read the output from our system based on signals sensed by the oscilloscope. Computations were performed on the collected data 
                     to determine the sideband rejection ratio, which was eventually plotted againt the frequencies of the input signals using the Matplotlib library.</p>
