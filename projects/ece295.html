                <p>This project involved writing modules in System Verilog to handle the timing of receiving serial digital data from an ADC and converting it to parallel data, digitally processing the signals with finite-impulse response filters implemented in System Verilog, and then converting the parallel data back to serial data that could be sent back to a DAC to be output. </p>

                <p>As part of the design process, Altium Designer was used to design a PCB that would interface the DAC/ADC with the DESoc MAX 10 FPGA we were using for the digital signal processing, which we eventually submitted to be manufactured, then 
                    soldered our compontents to.</p>

                <p> Matlab was used to determine proper filter coefficients that could be used to achieve our desired results, as well as predict the magnitude and impulse responses of the filters as a measure of their efficacy.</p>

                <p>                    We also extended template testbenches that were provided to suit our needs and evaluated the digital design using ModelSim when we were experiencing inconsistent results. This Waveform of our DSP system (ModelSim), is based on specific inputs forced by a testbench that we modified for debugging purposes.</p>

                <p>Frequent manual testing using laboratory instrumentation such as waveform generators/oscilloscopes/DMMs were used to debug and evaluate our design. For example. generating a test AM signal, demodulating it with our device, and reading the output on an oscilloscope.</p>

                <p>Eventually, automated testing helped us evaluate our final design, for example, the sideband rejection ratio of our design. The PyVISA library was used to connect to measurement instruments, which controlled stimuli (eg: generating signals of varying amplitudes and frequencies on the waveform generator), then read the output from our system based on signals sensed by the oscilloscope. The collected data was graphed using the Matplotlib library.</p>
