            <p>This project involved writing modules in System Verilog to handle the timing of receiving digital data from an ADC and converting it to paralell data, digitally processing the signals with a finite-impulse response filter, and then sending the signals back to a DAC to be output. As part of the design process, Altium Designer was used to 
            design a PCB that would interface the DAC/ADC with the DESoc MAX 10 FPGA we were using for the digital signal processing, then soldering the components of the PCB together. Matlab was used to determine proper filter coefficients that could be used to 
            achieve our desired results, as well as predict the impulse response of the filter. We also wrote our own testbenches and evaluated the digital design using ModelSim when we were experiencing inconsitent results, and finally, both manual, and automated testing using oscilloscopes/DMMs and the PyVisa Library were used to debug and evaluate our design.</p>
